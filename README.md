# jfg_server_lib

A (quite simple) java server implementation I used for online multiplayer games.

The implementation uses a server that is reachable from the internet to create peer-to-peer connections to the clients and manage the communication.

It includes simple echo-servers, grouping-servers, login-servers...


The servers are not realy fast or well tested. I mostly used them to learn about client-server comunication in java and to build a turn based multiplayer game with it.
